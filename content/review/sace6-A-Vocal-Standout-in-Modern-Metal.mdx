Let me just start by saying this: if you’re not paying attention to sace6 yet, you will be soon. Last night at Paradise Rock Club, they opened for Don Broco and basically walked in with “future headliner” written all over them.

Frontman Sace possesses one of the most striking voices currently emerging in the metal and alternative heavy scene. While many vocalists lean on sheer force or raw grit, Sace delivers something entirely different, a smooth, effortlessly controlled tone that cuts through distortion with clarity and warmth. It’s a sound rarely heard in this genre. Live, his vocals were not only impressive, but remarkably consistent, even as the band’s energy surged around him. It’s no exaggeration to say his voice may be one of the most distinctive to hit the scene in recent years.

While Sace carried the vocal the performance, Noah supplied the kinetic counterpart. His onstage presence was nothing short of electric. His energy elevated each track, turning the set into a dynamic push-and-pull between smooth melody and frenetic intensity.

The chemistry between the two felt natural and exciting, creating a front-line partnership that’s rare for a band still in its early rise.

If this performance is any indication, sace6 are poised for rapid ascension. They have the rare combination of a frontman with a standout, genre-defying voice, a dynamic stage presence in Noah, and a collective sound that feels ready for bigger rooms and larger audiences.

Their set at Paradise Rock Club wasn’t just a strong opening slot — it was the unmistakable spark of a band preparing to break through in a major way.

For fans who caught them early, this show may go down as one of those “I saw them before they blew up” moments. Sace6 proved they are not only capable openers, but potential future headliners.

Because trust me: sace6 aren’t staying an opener for long.
