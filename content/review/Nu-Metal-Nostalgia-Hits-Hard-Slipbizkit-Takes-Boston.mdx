Last night at Brighton Music Hall, the nu-metal faithful were treated to an absolute blast from the past courtesy of Slipbizkit, New England’s premier tribute to the kings of late-’90s aggression and angst. From the moment the lights dimmed and the first distorted chord hit, it was clear this wasn’t nostalgia with a wink, it was a full-throttle dive back into the sound and fury that defined an era.

The band’s energy was relentless, but what really stood out was how talented they are as musicians. Every part was tight and intentional, from the crushing guitars to the locked-in rhythm section that kept the room moving all night. The vocals cut through with confidence and intensity, capturing the attitude and emotion that made this genre so powerful in the first place.

That passion translated directly to the crowd. The room was packed with fans who clearly came for the nostalgia, and they were loving every minute of it. People were moshing, jumping, and shouting along, fully embracing the chaos. There was a shared sense of joy in reliving a genre that meant so much to so many, the kind of night where strangers become friends in the pit and everyone leaves smiling and sweaty.

It also felt like proof that nu metal is making a real comeback. Alongside longtime fans reliving their glory days, there were plenty of young faces discovering the sound for the first time. The mix of generations gave the show an electric atmosphere, blending nostalgia with fresh excitement in a way that felt genuinely special.

By the end of the night, Brighton Music Hall was buzzing. Slipbizkit didn’t just put on a great show, they reminded everyone why nu metal still hits hard when it’s played with real heart, skill, and unfiltered enthusiasm. If you’re passionate about nu metal, you would absolutely love Slipbizkit.
